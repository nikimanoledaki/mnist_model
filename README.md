# Classify handwritten digits

## Identifying the problem
The problem that I am trying to solve here is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (28 x 28 pixels) into their 20 categories (0 through 9). 

## Resources
This project uses the Python library Keras, as well as a TensorFlow backend.

It also uses the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 60,000 training images, plus 10,000 test images, assembled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the 1980s.
